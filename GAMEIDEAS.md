# Game Ideas

Ideas for some multiplayer games we could implement for FujiNet!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Play-by-Mail Games

These are two player games where, I imagine, a server
would maintain the state of many games, including multiple
games for an individual user.  There would be no time limit
for a player to make their move (like there is with 5-Card Stud).

Once a move is made, the opponent would see this the next time they
launch the app.  Each user could be maintaining multiple games against
multiple other opponents, or even multile games against the same opponent.

### Chess

(No description needed, I think!)

### Checkers / Draughts

(No description needed, I think!)

### Hnefatafl aka Viking Chess

(Idea from Bill K. h/t my wife Melissa for sharing an iOS
version she plays.)

A tafl game.  The traditional is played on an 11x11 board
with two players -- one offence, the other defence -- taking
turns.

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tafl_games

### Bagh-Chal ("Tiger Game")

(Idea from Bill K. h/t Tibet Nepal in Davis, CA, which had
a game out on display decades ago.)

The game is played on a 5x5 point grid, with pieces placed
at the intersections.  Gameplay takes place in two phases:
first, the goats are placed on the board while the tigers are moved;
then, goats and tigers both move.  The tigers' objective is to capture
(jump over, a la Checkers/Draughts) five goats; the goats win by blocking
all the tigers' legal moves.

# Sample Makefile
#
# Copy this Makefile to your local project and edit as needed. It works with cc65 and this repo to create clean
# easy builds that will pull down fujinet-lib for you automatically...
#
# Set the TARGETS and PROGRAM values as required.
# Set the FujinetLib version you want to include.
# See makefiles/build.mk for details on directory structure for src files and how to add custom extensions to the build.
#
# delete all comments above this when you use this as your Makefile

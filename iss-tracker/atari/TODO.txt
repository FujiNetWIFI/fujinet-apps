TODO for ISS Tracker for #FujiNet
2024-04-06
 * Switch to fujinet-lib needed some Makefile changes that were pulled from other projects, but they can probably be cleaned up a lot


2022-05-29

 * Better error handling! (See FIXMEs)

 * May need to deal with Unicode characters in astronaut names!

 * Handle VERSION number in one place (Makefile)

 * Allow adjusting colors.
   * Save colors to FujiNet (app key); reload on start-up.

Other ideas:

 * Show night/day

API KEY
This program requires an API KEY from openweathermap.org.
1. Get your own API KEY. 
(Since the program uses One Call v.3.0, 
 you will need to register for the “One Call by Call” subscription plan.)

2. Put the contents of the KEY (32 bytes long) into a file named '56000101.key'.

3. Save the file in the /Fujinet directory of your Fujinet SD card.

# FujiLink I for Coleco ADAM

This is an in-progress terminal program for FujiNet users.

## Depedencies

This requires the following libraries to function:

* https://github.com/tschak909/eoslib
* https://github.com/tschak909/smartkeyslib

Build each, place the .lib files in $Z88DK/lib/clibs.
Place the .h files in $Z88DK/include

Then the main program should be able to be built with simply:

``` sh
make
```
